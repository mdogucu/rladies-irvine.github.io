      <description>Hi everyone!
This month&amp;rsquo;s meeting will be a series of lightning talks given by you!
In this fun, informal setting, participants will have approximately 5-10 minutes (length depending on number of responses) to speak about their research, work, or a puzzle they’re trying to solve with R – anything goes! Our goals are to (1) provide a space to learn about others in our community and (2) exchange ideas about the methodologies, interests, and tools we all are using.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
As tutorials on packages (specifically the tidyverse, and in particular, ggplot2) were the most popular requests in our survey, this meeting will be a workshop exploring the wonders of ggplot2!
Please bring your laptops and have R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package installed and working. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re having issues with any of these, don&amp;rsquo;t worry! We&amp;rsquo;re all here to help. :)
