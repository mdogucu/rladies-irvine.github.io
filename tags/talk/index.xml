      <description>Hi everyone!
This month&amp;rsquo;s meeting will be a series of lightning talks given by you!
In this fun, informal setting, participants will have approximately 5-10 minutes (length depending on number of responses) to speak about their research, work, or a puzzle they’re trying to solve with R – anything goes! Our goals are to (1) provide a space to learn about others in our community and (2) exchange ideas about the methodologies, interests, and tools we all are using.</description>
